    \section*{Bitcoin Mechanics and Optimizations}
    
    After abstracting away Bitcoin features to understand Bitcoin's fundamental principles and design, it's time to dive into how Bitcoin works on a technical level. In this note, we will cover topics such as advanced Bitcoin mechanics, scripting, and network optimizations techniques. Through these topics, we intend on demonstrating that Bitcoin's design philosophy is as simple, robust, and conservative as possible.
    
     \section*{Double Spend --- Example}
 
     To gain further intuition on Bitcoin consensus, it is important to understand how double spending works. Previously, we defined a ``double spend" as a circumstance in which a party successfully spends the same funds more than once. In real life, it's as if you used a single dollar bill in two separate purchases. Physically, it's impossible to double spend, but the virtual world creates issues. For example, if Alice wants to purchase something from Bob for 1.00 BTC, she can double spend by creating two transactions: send 1.00 BTC to Bob in one transaction, and 1.00 BTC to herself in another. The double spend is successful if the transaction to herself is the one accepted by the network, which will allow her to keep the money and fool Bob. Double spends are possible when a party gains more than 50\% of the network's hash power. Under the hood, there is a fairly involved process that results in the double spend.
     
     \section*{Double Spend --- Confirmations}
     
     A transaction's \textbf{confirmations} are defined as the blocks built off of the block containing the transaction. All transactions in the block at the tip of the blockchain have 0 confirmations, as there are no newer blocks yet. A transaction's confirmation quantity will be one less than the block depth: the most recent block is at depth 1 and has 0 confirmations, and every next block will increase both the depth and confirmations by one.
 
  \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{confirmations}
  
  Because of the difficulty of finding the proof-of-work for each block, confirmations roughly determine the security of transactions. In order to double spend a transaction, one must calculate the proof-of-work for each block until their fork of the blockchain is the longest. In the diagram above, one would have to calculate 3 different proofs-of-work starting with the block with 2 confirmations, to reach the same height as the most recent block. This is also assuming that the double spender has a significantly higher hash rate than that of the rest of the network, which is working on the original blockchain.
  
  What about transactions with no confirmations at all? Suppose Bob does not wait for \textit{any} confirmations on Alice's transaction. He simply checks that the transaction from Alice is valid, and \textit{immediately} sends Alice the product he is selling. Since there are no confirmations on Bob's transaction, Bob is vulnerable to a \textbf{race attack}. Alice can send a competing transaction to herself at the same time she sends Bob the legitimate transaction. Alice can then broadcast the transaction to the entire network. The false, conflicting transaction Alice sends is propagated much faster than the single transaction she sends to Bob, so there is a high likelihood that one of the Alice's conflicting transactions will be mined into a block and accepted by the network as genuine. Alice can also increase the block fee for the transaction to provide more incentive for miners to include the illegitimate transaction into their blocks. In this case, merchant Bob's waiting for 0 transactions makes him vulnerable to anyone that wants to steal goods. 
  
  On the other hand, in the case that Bob waits for more than 1 confirmation ($z$ confirmations), Alice can still double spend, but the process is more involved. Say Alice sends Bob a transaction, and Bob waits $z$ confirmations before he sends the goods to Alice. In order to double spend on Bob, Alice must mine on her own private chain, one that does not have the transaction that sent bitcoin from Alice to Bob; Alice can send the same transaction to herself instead. She builds up an illegitimate transaction history such that she sends money to herself rather than to Bob. After mining $z$ blocks, and making sure that her chain is longer than any other chain, Alice can broadcast her chain (preferably after she receives the goods from Bob). The network will adopt Alice's chain over the previous chain because it is longer in length. In fact, it is proven that if Alice has greater than 50\% of the total hash power, then she can always have a longer, illegitimate chain. \\ \\
 
   \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{z_confirmation} \\
   
   \section*{Double Spend --- Security}
   
   Now we'll model our assertions regarding double spending and hash power using mathematics:
   
   Suppose Bob waits for $z$ confirmations before sending his goods over to Alice. Alice has $h_A$ hash power, and the honest network has $h_H$ hash power. The total network hash power is then $h_A + h_H$. 
   
   The probability, $p$, of the honest network finding the next block is simply the proportion of hash power the honest network controls:
   
   $$p = \frac{h_H}{h_A + h_H} $$
   
   The probability, $q$, of Alice finding the next block is the complement of $p$. We calculate it as follows:
   
   \begin{equation*}
       \begin{split*}
           q = 1-p &= 1 - \frac{h_H}{h_A + h_H} \\
           &= \frac{h_A}{h_A + h_H}
       \end{split*}
   \end{equation*}
   
   Consider the scenario in which the honest network mines $z$ blocks on top of Alice's transaction to him. Bob sees that there are $z$ confirmations, and then he sends the goods over to Alice. In the meantime, Alice has been hard at work mining on her own chain ever since sending her transaction over, in hopes of double spending on Bob. The expected number of blocks Alice would have mined after the $z$ confirmations is equal to:
   
   $$\lambda = z(\frac{q}{p})$$
   
   If we model this as a Poisson distribution, because we have discrete events each corresponding to a probability, we can show that the probability that Alice generates $k$ blocks is:
   
   $$p_A(k) = \frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!}$$
   
   Now the question is: What is the probability Alice can mine enough blocks in secret to successfully broadcast her chain with the double spend? In other words, what is the probability that Alice can produce a longer chain than the honest network? 
   
   To solve this, first consider the related problem of Alice trying to catch up to a chain that is $j$ blocks ahead of Alice's own chain. The corresponding question is: What is the probability that Alice will ever catch up given an unlimited number of trials? It is also important to consider that the honest network is continuously mining their blocks on their chain, while Alice works maliciously on the side. This problem is actually an instance of the \textbf{Gambler's Ruin} problem, which in this case means that if Alice has more than 50\% hash power, she can always generate a longer chain, given an infinite timeline. The following is the probability of Alice catching up if she is $j$ blocks behind: 
   
   \[ p_c(j) = \begin{cases} 
      1 & q \geq p \text{ OR } j < 0 \\
      \big(\frac{q}{p}\big)^j & q < p
   \end{cases}
   \]
   
   Combining these two probabilities, we can compute the probability that Alice can catch up after $z$ blocks mined on the honest chain. Consider the case when Alice mines $k$ blocks. This means that the honest chain is $z-k$ blocks ahead of Alice. We sum over all possible values of $k$:
   
   \begin{equation*}
       \begin{split}
           &\Sigma_{k=0}^\infty p_A(k) \cdot p_C(z-k) \\
           = &\Sigma_{k=0}^\infty \frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!} \cdot  \left\{
    \begin{array}{ll}
      1  & k > z \\ 
      \big(\frac{q}{p}\big)^{z-k} & k \leq z \\
    \end{array}
  \right.
       \end{split}
   \end{equation*}
   
      \includegraphics[scale=1]{doublespend_plots} \\
   
    The above shows Alice's probability of catching up to the honest chain in arbitrary $x$ number of blocks. If Alice has 50\% hash power or more, then she can catch up with 100\% probability. Probability of catching up to the honest chain decreases as Alice's probability $q$ of getting the next block decreases.
    
    To avoid infinite tail, discrete summation, we can look at the inverse probability that Alice \textit{cannot} catch up to the chain that is $j$ blocks ahead:
    
    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{split}
           & 1 - \Sigma_{k=0}^\infty \frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!} \cdot  \left\{
    \begin{array}{ll}
      1  & k > z \\ 
      \big(\frac{q}{p}\big)^{z-k} & k \leq z \\
    \end{array}
  \right. \\
  &= 1 -\Sigma_{k=0}^\infty \frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!} \cdot \Bigg(1- \big(\frac{q}{p}\big)^{z-k}\Bigg)
        \end{split}
    \end{equation*}
    
    The number of confirmations Bob should wait before sending Alice the goods depends on how much hash power Bob assumes Alice to control. For the average user, it is recommended they wait around 6 or more confirmation until accepting a transaction. However, this is assuming any malicious party controls roughly 10\% or less of the network hash power. 
    
    \section*{Double Spend --- Bribing Miners}
    
    We have shown that if Alice controls more than 50\% of the total network hash power, she will always be able to double spend. Looking back at our calculations, whenever Alice is arbitrary $j$ blocks behind the honest network's chain, she will \textit{always} (in expectation) be able to catch up and out-produce the honest miners. Therefore, the probability that Alice can successfully double spend with greater than 50\% network hash power reaches 1.
    
    In reality, it is extremely costly, and approaching impossible, for Alice to own so much network hash power, especially given how vast the Bitcoin network is currently. Alice might not physically control the mining hardware necessary to perform a double spend, but she can definitely bribe other miners or even entire mining pools to mine on her chain. In the long run, it is guaranteed that Alice and her miners will profit, but the initial cost is extremely high.
    
    \section*{Double Spend --- "Gold Finger" Attack}
    
    There is actually a compelling reason as to why Alice would not want to double spend. If Alice does in fact succeed in a double spend, the rest of the network would be able to detect her double spend. Confidence in Bitcoin and the exchange rate would plummet as a result of the discovery of a security breach. Alice's bitcoin would then be worth a lot less, assuming Alice is staked in Bitcoin at the time. 
    
    If Alice is not staked in Bitcoin, she can short Bitcoin in order to profit after her double spend. Alice can short the exchange rate, and use that as collateral to buy, rent, or bribe miners, cashing out on the short.
    
    One slightly terrifying outcome of this analysis is when we consider the possibility of Alice being a hostile government, adversarial altcoin, or large financial institution, with a large amount of capital available. Alice would then be able to acquire enough mining equipment or bribe enough miners or pools to achieve greater than 50\% hash power. Alice can then perform a so-called \textbf{Gold Finger attack}, with the objective of destroying the target cryptocurrency with a double spend or spamming the network with empty blocks.
    
    (Note: The Gold Finger attack is named after the famous villain Auric Goldfinger in the third James Bond movie, who poisons the US gold supply in Ft. Knox in an effort to make the gold worth less, and to increase the value of his own gold holdings.)
    
    \section*{Account vs Transaction Based Ledgers}
    
    Consider the notion of \textbf{account based ledgers}. There are certain cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum which maintain account based ledgers. Each address in Ethereum has an account, and for a user to check how many tokens they have, they simply add the inputs and subtract the outputs. The downside to this method is that the system must track every single transaction that has ever affected that one account. Scaling this to many thousands of users, this method could be a performance issue. One way to fix this huge amount of data is to 'prune' away old transaction history so that the user does not have to deal with old transaction data. This method has proven to be error-prone however, due to the additional block maintenance that is required. 
    
    On the contrary, Bitcoin is a \textbf{transaction-based ledger} (known as triple-entry accounting.) Users are always spending from previous outputs. As we mentioned in Note 2, UTXOs (unspent transaction outputs) can only be spent once, so Bitcoin has change addresses. By restricting UTXO usage and introducing the concept of change addresses, Bitcoin has a very efficient verification system. To determine how many tokens a user has, simply total the amounts associated with their recent UTXOs. The state of the Bitcoin network is only dependent on the most recent history. Bitcoin also supports joint payments, so that a transaction can have multiple inputs -- for example if Alice and Bob both want to pitch in to spend a total of 1.00 BTC. In practice, this feature is rarely used but is supported nonetheless.
    
    \section*{Contents of a Transaction}
    
    The contents of an actual transaction in Bitcoin can be split into three sections: the metadata, inputs, and outputs. 
    
   \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{transaction_contents}
   
   As seen above, a transaction folllows JSON structure. Metadata contains information such as the hash of the current transaction (often times referred to as the transaction ID), the version number (currently 1), the number of inputs and outputs, lock time, and data size.
   
   Inputs to the transaction include a hash of a previous unspent transaction, and an index specifying the output of the previous transaction from which the user is spending. Transaction outputs are ordered, so an index is required to identify specific outputs in a transaction. Inputs also need a signature as a cryptographic proof of ownership. 
   
   The outputs of a transaction include an output amount in BTC as well as an output script. The output script is what enables the parties associated with the transaction to claim their bitcoin later on, using a system called the Pay-to-PubkeyHash, which we will discuss later.
   
   \section*{Bitcoin Scripting}
   
   Previously we may have made the abstraction that transactions map input addresses to output addresses. In practice, these "addresses" we have been referring to are really scripts. By defining inputs and outputs through scripting, we can allow for the future extensibility of Bitcoin because scripting is such a low level feature that could potentially support many other future operations if needed. Recall that a signature proves the ownership of a public key, and that the Bitcoin address is a hash of the public key.
   
   $$Hash(PubKey)~==~Address~==~"PubKeyHash"$$
   
   Inputs and outputs are scripts that \underline{specify} these addressses, and sending money through transactions involves \underline{redeeming} previously unspent transaction outputs.
   
   So outputs in a transaction must be constructed in a way that tells the network:
   
   "This amount can be redeemed by a \underline{signature} from the owner of address X." 
   
   However, by the cryptographic property of preimage resistance, we know that we cannot find a public key given an address. What the transaction should really be saying is:
   
   "This amount can be redeemed by the \underline{public key} that hashes to address X, plus a \underlline{signature} from the owner of that public key."
   
   Only the owner of the public key would be able to produce the valid signature necessary to redeem the bitcoin from the output script.
   
   To make input scripts compatible with output scripts, we concatenate the input script to the output script, in that order. Input scripts are called \textbf{scriptSigs} and output scripts are called \textbf{scriptPubKeys}. This is because output scripts are specified by the senders of the transaction. Outputs need to know a provider -- a public key that hashes to the associated address, and makes sure that the signature matches.
   
  \includegraphics[scale=1]{output_script}
  
  In terms of code execution, scripts are run line by line, top to bottom. Notice in the diagram how the scriptSig is followed by the scriptPubKey because of the concatenation convention, and also because outputs need to know where the funds are coming from. 
  
  The Bitcoin scripting language, called \textbf{Script}, (the former is used frequently too) is a simple stack based language. There exists no support for loops, so the language is not Turing complete, but there exists native support for cryptography, making the language very specialized for its own needs. In fact, the entire signature verification process can be written in code as one instruction.
  
  Next, we present an example execution of the previously shown script. 

\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{script_execution} \\

 The first two steps are $<$sig$>$ and $<$pubKey$>$, so we push those to the stack in that order. Next, OP\_DUP simply duplicates the most recent instruction, so by the end of executing the third instruction, there are two $<$pubKey$>$'s. OP\_HASH160 hashes the topmost item, $<$pubKey$>$, into $<$pubKeyHash$>$, as the name implies. $<$pubKeyHash?$>$ is the address that redeemers of the output must hash their public key to. Next, in the instruction OP\_EQUALVERIFY, the script checks to see if $<$pubKey$>$ truly hashes to the address $<$pubKeyHash?$>$. The script then cross checks this with the signature, $<$sig$>$, in OP\_CHECKSIG, which returns true if the redeemer of this output is truly verified to spend from this output. In a nutshell, the script returns either true or false, depending on the legitimacy of the $<$sig$>$ and $<$pubKey$>$ that are passed in. 
 
 The output is saying: "This amount can be redeemed by
 \begin{enumerate}
     \item the $<$pubKey$>$ that hashes to the address $<$pubKeyHash?$>$
     \item plus a $<$sig$>$ from the owner of that $<$pubKey$>$, which will make the output script evaluate to true."
 \end{enumerate}
 
 \section*{Proof of Burn}
 
 One application of Bitcoin scripting is to implement something known as a \textbf{proof-of-burn}, which allows a user to prove the existence of some data in exchange for destroying bitcoin. There exists an instruction named OP\_RETURN that throws an error when reached, stopping code execution. By placing this instruction anywhere in an output script before the script returns either true or false, we can effectively make it so that no one can redeem that output. We have \textit{burned} that coin. Anything that exists after the OP\_RETURN will never be executed, but this allows us to prove its existence cryptographically.
 
 \includegraphics[scale=1]{burn_script} \\
 
 As seen in the sample script above, as long as we're willing to burn coin, we can prove the existence of anything at a particular point in time. This would be a word you coined, a hash of a document, music, your creative works, etc. If Alice stores a hash of a word she coined in the blockchain via proof-of-burn, she could then show everyone that "Alice coined word asdf at time 12345." Any data stored in this way in the blockchain is valid because blocks are timestamped. This is especially true when considering that the blockchain is provably immutable with honest actors. There have also been instances of burning bitcoin to bootstrap the value of other cryptocurrencies. To bootstrap an imaginary SuperAwesomeCoin, Super Awesome Bob could require users to burn bitcoin in order to get superAwesomeCoin. 
 
 \section*{Pay-to-PubKey-Hash vs Pay-to-Script-Hash}
 
 The previous example of requiring a public key and a signature in order to spend from a transaction output script is a use case of \textbf{P2PKH (pay-to-pubkey-hash)}, in which the vendor says "send your coins to the hash of this public key." This scheme represents the simplest and by far the most common case of transaction.
 
 However, for more complicated scripts, such as those which require multiple signature verification, P2PKH no longer works. For instance, if a merchant wants Alice to send coin payment to an output that allows the merchant to spend using multiple signatures, how would Alice know how to specify such a complicated script?
 
 The solution is to use a \textbf{pay-to-script-hash (P2SH)}. To clarify, consider following general cases:
 
 \begin{itemize}
     \item P2PKH: ``Send your coins to the hash of this \underline{public key}''
     \item P2SH: ``Send your coins to the hash of this \underline{script}. To redeem those coins, you must reveal the script that has the given hash and provide \underline{data} that will make the script evaluate to true.''
 \end{itemize}
 
 One of the most important improvements to the Bitcoin protocol since its inception, P2SH offloads the burden of complicated script writing to recipients of a transaction. When a merchant wants to receive payments from a customer, they do not want to burden the customer with writing a complicated script that could potentially differ between merchants. Instead, the merchant alone is responsible for writing a correct and secure script for the transaction. Likewise, the optimal customer experience is one in which the customer does not have to care about what the script actually is. They should not have to know anything about the company stores funds; customers should just have to create a transaction, pay, and leave.
 
 \section*{Merkle Trees}
 
 Let's take a deeper dive into the specifics of merkle trees, which we briefly touched upon in note 2. As review, merkle trees are inary trees of hash pointers. Blobs of transaction data are hashed together, then their hashes are hashed together, until one element remains --- the merkle root. (Note: Merkle trees are always full. If there are gaps, duplicate the last transaction to fill in the gaps.)
 
 Because outputs of cryptographic hash functions are unique, by \underline{second preimage resistance}, merkle trees are very efficient. Just from analyzing the merkle root, it is possible to prove that the merkle tree, a large string of data, contains a certain substring. To prove inclusion of data in the merkle tree, one must provide root data and intermediate hashes. Then, once hashing everything together in order, one would compare the final hash to the merkle root. To take this proof, one would need to find hash preimages that hash to valueus in the merkle tree. As discussed earlier, second preimage resistance makes faking proofs in merkle trees extremely difficult and practically impossible.

 \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{merkle_proof} \\
 
 The figure above illustrates how one might prove the inclusion of a substring $data$, the circled leaf node. Provided the circled $data$, the proof proceeds as follows.
 
 \begin{enumerate}
     \item Hash $data$ and call it $H_{data}$
     \item Hash $H_{data}$ with the next intermediate hash (height 2)
     \item Continue hashing until we reach height 0
     \item Hashing the two hashes at height 0 results in $H_{root}$
     \begin{enumerate}
         \item If $H_{root}$ is the same as the merkle root, then we have proven the existence of $data$ within the merkle tree
         \item Else, the proof failed and the merkle tree does not contain $data$
     \end{enumerate}
 \end{enumerate}
 
 \section*{Merkle Trees --- Bitcoin Construction}
 
 There are two main hash structures in Bitcoin. The blockchain is a hash chain of blocks; the blocks are linked together and based off of each other. They are tamper evident because changing one block changes its hash, which mismatches with the next block's hash of the previous block. Merkle trees exist within blocks and are a way of storing transactions. Changing data within a merkle tree changes its hashes, ultimately bubbling up and changing the merkle root. Changing the merkle root in turn changes the hash of the block it's contained in, invalidating the block.
 
 \section*{Merkle Trees --- Mining, In More Detail}
 
 Previously, we explained for simplicity that for every block, miners hashed together the merkle root, the previous block's hash, and a nonce (varied value) to find a number that is below a certain target value. There are actually two nonces: one in the block header as mentioned, and one in the coinbase transaction, the transaction that is created by and paid out to the miner. Changing the nonce in the coinbase transaction changes the hash of the coinbase transaction, ultimately changing the merkle root.
 
 The reason why there are two nonces is to increase difficulty for the miner. The block header nonce is 32 bits by itself. A modern ASIC such as the Antminer S9 can hash at 14 TH/s. A simple calculation shows that it takes just 0.00031 seconds to compute all the possible combinations in the block header nonce. $2^{32} / 14,000,000,000,000 = 0.00031 \text{~seconds}$. A miner with the right hardware can exhaust all nonce combinations 3260 times per second. Therefore, it is imperative to change the merkle root by including the coinbase transaction nonce.
 
 A common strategy is to increment the coinbase nonce, and then run through all block header nonce combinations. A less efficient strategy is to increment the block header nonce, and then run through all combinations for the coinbase nonce. This is because changing the coinbase nonce changes the merkle root, and the change must propagate up the tree, wasting precious hash time. (Propagating up the merkle tree takes $\theta(\log N)$ time, whereas calculating a hash takes $\theta(1)$ time.) We want to minimize the time spent calculating new merkle tree hashes, so change the coinbase transaction as little times as possible.
 
 \section*{SPV --- Simplified Payment Verification}
 
 The current size of Bitcoin's blockchain is 122.7 gigabytes and growing. Miners, or ``full nodes'', are required to save the entire blockchain, but for the average user, such a requirement is not feasible if the aim is mass adoption. Enter \textbf{SPV (Simplified Payment Verification) nodes}, or ``thin'' clients. These nodes are designed to be lightweight, as their name implies. They only store the pieces of data needed to verify transactions that concern them, thus relieving the necessity to store the entire blockchain. Nearly all nodes in the Bitcoin network are SPV nodes because users are discouraged by the enormous download size. Those that do run full nodes exchange large amounts of storage and a high bandwidth for a shot at the block reward.
 
 SPV nodes only keep the block headers of the blockchain. This is done by querying different full nodes until the SPV node has the longest chain. To validate an incoming transaction, an SPV node queries full nodes to get the Merkle branch for that transaction. Then, the node hashes the transaction together with intermediate hashes to obtain a Merkle root, which is cross checked with the Merkle root in the corresponding block header that the SPV node has locally. The only thing left to do after this point is to wait for the transaction to have enough confirmations (six) before delivering any goods.
 
 \section*{SPV --- Security and Cost Analysis}
 
 By definition, SPV nodes do not have a full transaction history, and do not know the UTXO set. Therefore, SPV nodes do not have the same level of security as full nodes. The reason is that SPV nodes cannot check if every transaction included in a block is actually valid.
 
 One major assumption SPV nodes make in exchange for their light weight is that they assume incoming block headers are not a false chain. This is a fair assumption to make because block headers include the proof-of-work for each block, and it is very expensive for attackers to create blocks. Over the long term, as long as the majority of the network is honest, SPV nodes can safely assume that the longest chain is honest because malicious behavior is not sustainable. Another assumption is that there are other full nodes out in the network validating all transactions. It is often inefficient for big merchants to query remote full nodes to verify transactions. Instead, it makes sense to keep a full blockchain to run fast local checks. Lastly, SPV nodes also assume that miners ensure that the transactions they include in their bocks are valid. If a miner were to include an invalid transaction, after they find the proof-of-work for that block and propagate it, other full nodes would reject their block because of the invalid transaction. Thus, miners are well incentivized to make sure all transactions in their blocks are valid.
 
 The storage tradeoff for running an SPV is huge. Bock headers are only around $\frac{1}{1000}$ the size of the full blockchain. This translates to ~123 MB vs. 123 GB. SPV nodes capitalize on obtaining data for verifying transactions lazily, relying on data from full nodes rather than keeping it locally. For most consumers and users of Bitcoin, SPV is a decent tradeoff.

 \section*{Flooding Algorithm}
 
 We mentioned that SPV nodes query full nodes to get data on block headers. The mechanism through which an SPV node establishes connection to full nodes is worthy of analysis too, especially since we have been fairly hand-wavy when refering to the ``Bitcoin network.''
 
 The Bitcoin network ensures that all nodes are equal; there exist no hierarchy of nodes or special nodes that have priority in any process: consensus, transactions, etc. The network is thus fully decentralized. The Bitcoin network is also defined by the property of random topology, meaning that each node in the network pairs with random nodes. Messages between nodes are generally taken as true, and the default behavior for nodes is to accept whichever message they hear about first, but this is not a strictly enforced rule in the network.
 
 The process of joining the Bitcoin network is aided by the presence of hard-coded \textbf{seed nodes} in the Bitcoin software. The algorithm is as follows:
 \begin{enumerate}
     \item Pick a seed node and ask for its peers
     \item Ask those peers for their peers, etc.
     \item Eventually, you pick a random set of nodes to pair with. These nodes become your peers.
 \end{enumerate}
 
 In general, this type of message-sending schema is characterized by its pairwise connections, and is called a \textbf{flooding algorithm} or \textbf{gossip protocol}. The end goal is for the entire network to hear about a transaction. Consider a simple example with our favorite characters Alice and Bob:
 
 \begin{enumerate}
     \item Alice wants to pay Bob, so Alice first constructs a transaction and tells all of her peers
     \item Her peers conduct checks on the transaction and if it passes, they relay the transaction to their peers
     \item Each peer conducts checks such as the following: \begin{itemize}
         \item Does the script for each previous output being redeemed return true?
         \item Have all redeemed outputs not been spent?
         \item Have I already seen this transaction? Do not relay it if so.
         \item Only accept and relay ''standard scripts``: based off a small whitelist of scripts.
     \end{itemize}
     \item Eventually, the transaction makes it to Bob
 \end{enumerate}
 
 \section*{Bitcoin Relay Network}
 
 One problem Bitcoin is currently facing is \textbf{mining pool centralization}. Miners are incentives to join large mining pools because smaller mining pools generally experience higher orphaning rates due to lesser hash power and network connectivity. Large pool on the other hand have lower block orphan rates becauses of the effects of \textbf{block propagation delays}.
 
 One solution to this issue is the adoption of the \textbf{Bitcoin Relay Network}, also known as the Fast Relay Network. The idea is to serve a high speed ``railroad for block data.'' The design involves installing nodes in China/Asia, Europe, North America, etc., prioritizing first where the majority of miners are geographically located. Each of the nodes would have a fast internet connection, and would be able to relay data via compression and transmission via TCP to nearby miners. This would rapidly improve bock propagation speed, and thus reduce the number of orphaned blocks.
 
 The problem with the Bitcoin Relay Network is that it relies on TCP as its connectivity protocol. TCP is susceptible to data loss. A sender might send $x$ number packets of data to a receiver, but not all $x$ may arrive. In the case where not all packets arrive, the receiver is notified, and can then ask to sender to resend the missing packets. This causes a round trip delay for the time-sensitive data.
 
 \section*{FIBRE}
 
 After realizing the problems with the Bitcoin Relay Network, developers conceptualized \textbf{FIBRE (Fast Internet Bitcoin Relay Engine)}. Problems with the Bitcoin Relay Network boiled down to its reliance on TCP, which only implements error correction at the IP leve. It uses ARQ (Automatically Repeat Request) to fix errors, which requires another round trip from receiver to sender, back to the receiver. FIBRE fixes this by opting for UDP (user Datagram Protocol), which allows for FEC (Forward Error Correction). This means that if there are errors in FIBRE, the receiver is ale to reconstruct the correct data block without having to contact the sender to send it again. The sender simply includes extra packets to account for potential packet loss or corruption.
