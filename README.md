# Blockchain-Notes
Meticulous notes on various topics in cryptography, cryptocurrencies, and blockchain based on Blockchain at Berkeley's Spring 2017 "Introduction to Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain" course.    

Note: This project is currently undergoing active development on ShareLatex. Updates to this repo may or may not be frequent. I'll post a link to the final PDF with all notes organized in a textbook style when the project nears completion. Open sourcing this project on GitHub for blockchain reasons.
